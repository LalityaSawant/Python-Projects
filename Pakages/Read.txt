Packages are great for organizing code

eg : in shop you have sections like Men Women Kids
here sections can be packages

then each package can have further Modules like T-shirt Shoes Jackets

there are different ways of importing packages as shown in program
1. import complete package --> access via packagename.Modulename.methodname Eg: import ecommerce.shipping
2. import specific module from package --> access via modulename.metjodname Eg: from ecommerce import shipping
3. import specific methods from packae.module --> access directly by modulename Eg: from ecommerce.shipping import calc_shipping, calc_tax
