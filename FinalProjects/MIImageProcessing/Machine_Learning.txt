Steps for Machine Learning:
1. Importing Data
2. Cleaning Data
3. Split data into Training(80%)/Test sets(20%)
4. Create Model
5. Train the Model
6. Make Predictions
7. Evaluate and Improve

Libraries inMachine Learning:
Numpy --> Provides multi dimensional array
Pandas --> Data analysis library which provide a concept called data frame, 2 dimensional data structure similar to excel sheet
MatPlotLib --> Two dimensional plotting library for creating graphs and plot
Scikit-learn --> Provides common algorithms like decision tre Neural networks etc

Tool:
For Machine learning we use Jupyter tool -- better to visualize and inspect data n fly
To install jupyter we need platform called Anaconda platform www.anaconda.com/download/
